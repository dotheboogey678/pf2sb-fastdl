                <b>how are other people flying/spawning stuff/etc?</b>
                this is a sv_cheats 1 server. this server is <u>not</u> for actual games!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>why does the server crash so much?</b>
                i don't know. just rejoin. it should be back up in a few seconds. if not, i probably shut down the server intentionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>why not keep the server up all the time?</b>
                it's running on my machine, which i probably shouldn't keep on all the time.
